# Overview

Flux Validator is a framework that lets validate any type of data.

The framework uses a schema, plugins (leveraging the Kit dependency system), a factory, a manager and a widget:

![alt text](../data/images/flow_01.png)

## Plugins

There are 4 types of plugins:
- context
- selector
- check
- resultor (optional)

Each type of plugin has an "interface" (from `omni.flux.validator.factory`) that you can use to create/implement your plugin.

`omni.flux.validator.factory` is also used to register your plugin(s).

Each plugin will get some data from the [schema](#schema)

Each plugin can have a custom UI (to expose anything you want, to give an UI for the user to play with, etc etc).

Each plugin can "push" data using [DataFlow](#dataflow)

### Context plugin

A context plugin is a plugin that will setup the context of your validation.
Here 2 examples:
1. For example in Kit, you can have a context plugin that open a USD stage, or a context plugin that will use the current opened stage.
2. You can have a context that will define a working directory on a file system.

There are 2 types of context:
- the global context
- context by check plugin

The manager will set the context, and the context will run the validation process.

For context by check plugin, each context will run the check process.

A context plugin will do 2 things:
- check
- set
- exit

"Check" will check if your context can be setted up. For our first example, it will check if the USD file that you want to open exists.
For our second example, it will check if the working directory exists.

"Set" will set the context. For our first example, it will open the stage. For our second example it will `cd` into the working directory that we want.
"Set" needs to run the callback `await run_callback()` to run the check (inside the context itself).

"Exit" will exit the context. For example, if you need to save an USD stage on exit.

We can use the `Data` to read the folder path from the schema.

Here an implementation for the example 2:
Imagine a [schema](#schema) with a context plugin like this:
```python
{
    "context_plugin": {"name": "WorkingFolder", "data": {"folder_path": "C:\\Windows"}},
}
```

Here we will use the context plugin `WorkingFolder`. `WorkingFolder` needs the data `folder_path`, meaning it will check and set `folder_path` as working directory.

        pass
```

#### Flow
The core will run the context plugin first.

### Selector plugin

A selector plugin is a plugin that will select your data from your context.

A selector plugin is a plugin that a [check](#check-plugin) plugin will use.
You can have multiple selector plugin(s) "chained".

Here 2 examples:
1. For example in Kit, you can have a selector plugin that will select prim(s) in the stage, and chained selector plugin that will select a specific attribute for each prim.
2. You can have a selector plugin that will select/list all folders in the current working directory.

A selector plugin will do 1 thing:
- select

"Select" will select the data your need for the validation part that the [check](#check-plugin) need. For our first example, it will select all prims from the stage, and the second selector plugin will select the attribute "rotateX".
For our second example, it will list all folders from the current working directory.

Here an implementation for the example 2:
Imagine a [schema](#schema) with a selector plugin like this:
```python
{
    "context_plugin": {"name": "WorkingFolder", "data": {"folder_path": "C:\\Windows"}},
    "check_plugins": [
        {
            "name": "Example",
            "selector_plugins": [{"name": "GetAllFolders", "data": {}}],  # we set the selector plugin GetAllFolders to the check plugin Example
            "data": {},
            "context_plugin": {"name": "Nothing", "data": {}},
        },
    ],
}
```

Here we will use the context plugin `WorkingFolder`. `WorkingFolder` needs the data `folder_path`, meaning it will check and set `folder_path` as working directory.

```

### Check plugin

A check plugin is a plugin that will check and (optional) auto fix your data. This is the validation part.
Here 2 examples:
1. For example in Kit, you can have a check plugin that will check if we have at least 1 prim in the stage
2. You can a check plugin that will check if a folder exist in the current working directory from the list of the selector.

A check plugin will do 2 things:
- check
- fix (optional)

"Check" will check your data (validation). For our first example, it will check the data from the selector plugin(s) and see if the resulting list is empty or not.
For our second example, it will check if the sub folder exists.

"Fix" will try to fix the validation is needed. For example for the example 1., the auto fix would create 1 prim in the stage.
For the example 2., it would create the sub folder.

A check plugin has some options by default in the schema to stop/pause the validation: `stop_if_fix_failed` or `pause_if_fix_failed`.
Please check the schema of check plugin to see all options.

Here an implementation for the example 2:
Imagine a [schema](#schema) with a context plugin like this:
```python
{
    "context_plugin": {"name": "WorkingFolder", "data": {"folder_path": "C:\\Windows"}},
    "check_plugins": [
        {
            "name": "SubFolderExist",
            "selector_plugins": [{"name": "GetAllFolders", "data": {}}],
            "data": {"sub_folder_name": "hello"},
            "context_plugin": {"name": "Nothing", "data": {}},
        },
    ],
}
```

Here, we will set `C:\\Windows` as working directory, run the selector that will list all folders from `C:\\Windows`, run the check plugin that checks if the sub folder `hello` exists.

### Resultor plugin

A resultor plugin is a plugin that will do what ever you want with the result of the validation.
Here 2 examples:
1. You can write the result into a json file
2. You can send the result into a web page

You can have multiple resultor plugins!

Here an implementation for the example 1:
Imagine a [schema](#schema) with a context plugin like this:
```python
{
    "context_plugin": {"name": "WorkingFolder", "data": {"folder_path": "C:\\Windows"}},
    "check_plugins": [
        {
            "name": "SubFolderExist",
            "selector_plugins": [{"name": "GetAllFolders", "data": {}}],
            "data": {"sub_folder_name": "hello"},
            "context_plugin": {"name": "Nothing", "data": {}},
        },
    ],
    # resultor plugin here
    "resultor_plugins": [{"name": "ToJson", "data": {"json_path": "C:\\result.json"}}],
}
```

Here, at the end of the validation, it will grab the result of the validation and write it into a json file here `C:\\result.json`.

Keep in mind that the result of the validation is inside the [schema](#schema) itself.

```

#### Flow
The plugin(s) will be run at the end of the validation (after the last checker plugin) one by one.


## Schema
A schema will define what plugins you want to use to do your validation.
It will define:
- the context plugin
- the selector plugin(s) for each check plugin(s)
- the check plugin(s)
- the resultor plugin(s)

From our example:
```python
{
    "context_plugin": {"name": "WorkingFolder", "data": {"folder_path": "C:\\Windows"}},
    "check_plugins": [
        {
            "name": "SubFolderExist",
            "selector_plugins": [{"name": "GetAllFolders", "data": {}}],
            "data": {"sub_folder_name": "hello"},
            "context_plugin": {"name": "Nothing", "data": {}},
        },
    ],
    "resultor_plugins": [{"name": "ToJson", "data": {"json_path": "C:\\result.json"}}],
}
```

Here it will use the context plugin `WorkingFolder`, that will set the working directory to `C:\\Windows`.

After, it will run the check plugin `SubFolderExist`. But first, the check plugin will run the selector plugin `GetAllFolders`.

`GetAllFolders` will get all the folder(s) from the current context that was set (`C:\\Windows`), it will pass the result to the check plugin `SubFolderExist`.

`SubFolderExist` will check is the folder `hello` exists in the list that the selector plugin `GetAllFolders` gave. If not, it will create the folder in the context (`C:\\Windows`).

So at the end we would have `C:\\Windows\\hello` folder.

To finish, it will write the current updated schema (with the results inside) into a json file `C:\\result.json`

## DataFlow

`DataFlow` are used to push/save any data into the schema. Those data can be used at any stage of the process.

Each plugin is responsible for the implementation of how they want to push the data into a `DataFlow` component.

First, we need to implement our `DataFlow` component. For this, we need to use the base `DataFlow` class from `omni.flux.validator.factory`
and define the name of the `DataFlow`, and other data we want to push/set.

Example:
```python
from typing import List, Optional

from .base_data_flow import DataFlow as _DataFlow


class OutDataFlow(_DataFlow):
    name: str = "OutData"
    output_data: Optional[List[str]] = None
    push_output_data: bool = False
```

Here we created a `DataFlow` component called `OutData`.

`OutData` will take `output_data`.

`output_data` will be pushed only if `push_output_data` is True.

That's it.

Now any plugin that want to use this `DataFlow` will need to implement it into the plugin.

First, the plugin will need to declare what compatible `DataFlow` that can be used, using the attribute `_compatible_data_flow_names`.

After, the plugin can define the typing of `data_flows` to be sure that we are getting the good `DataFlow` component.

Finally, the plugin can implement the `DataFlow`.

A schema with one check plugin like that:

{
    "name": "SubFolderExist",
    "selector_plugins": [{"name": "GetAllFolders", "data": {}}],
    "data": {"sub_folder_name": "hello", "data_flows": [{"name": "InOutData", "push_output_data": true}]},
    "context_plugin": {"name": "Nothing", "data": {}},
}
```

Here we can see that we pushed the output sub folder data.

At the end, this data can be read anywhere in the process like `schema.check_plugins[0].data.data_flows[0].output_data`


### Read the result

There are multiple ways to read the results:
- each plugin has some subscription(s). For example selector plugin(s) has `subscribe_select`. Please read the API.
- the schema that we give to the core will contain the result. For example selector plugin(s) has `last_select_result` and `last_select_message`. Please read the API.
```python
 'selector_plugins': [
    {'data': {'last_select_message': 'Ok',
              'last_select_result': True},
     'name': 'GetAllFolders'}
 ],
