## Getting Started

### Overview
RTX Remix app is built using the Kit SDK: https://docs.omniverse.nvidia.com/kit/docs/kit-manual/latest/guide/kit_overview.html

You need to read what is the Kit SDK (what is an extension, what is USD, and so on).

You can learn Pixar USD with those websites:
- https://learnusd.github.io/index.html
- https://lucascheller.github.io/VFX-UsdSurvivalGuide/index.html
- https://remedy-entertainment.github.io/USDBook/index.html

RTX Remix app uses a "barebone" Kit that we extend with extensions that we code. Those extensions come from
different repos (this one, Flux, etc etc...)


### Repos
The RTX Remix App is mainly built using 2 repos:
- this one
- Flux: https://gitlab-master.nvidia.com/omniverse/kit-extensions/kit-flux

#### Flux
Flux is a set of extensions that are not specific to the RTX Remix app, that can also be used anywhere else.

Meaning that there is no specific implementation of any app into Flux.

Example: we want the RTX Remix app to show a list of USD prims. What we can do here is:
- create an extension in Flux that will show a list of things (with no implementation of USD)
- create an extension in the RTX Remix app repo that will set the extension from Flux as a dependency, and implement
the USD stuffs.

Flux is like an "interface". Sometime Flux can also have some implementation when we see that those implementations
are "common use/general".

When there is something that we want to add to the RTX Remix app, and this thing is really specific to the RTX Remix
app, we code the extension directly into this repo (like the layout of the app).

When updating a Flux extension, and merging the Flux MR, a new version of this Flux extension will be published.

This repo would need a new MR to grab/pull the new version of the Flux extension. See [here](#flow-to-do-with-new-flux-extensions)

#### Building
1. Building the project for the first time:
   1. Clone this repo
   2. Build project: `build.bat -r`
   3. If required (recommended after switching branches) clean using: `build.bat -c`
2. Run:
   1. `_build\windows-x86_64\release\lightspeed.app.trex_dev.bat` for the dev version that has menus.
   2. `_build\windows-x86_64\release\lightspeed.app.trex.bat` for the end-user version.
   3. If you work on a specific sub-app (IngestCraft, TextureCraft...), you can run the sub-app directly like `_build\windows-x86_64\release\lightspeed.app.trex.ingestcraft.bat`

#### Flow to do with new Flux extensions
1. Build project: `build.bat -r -u`. Doing `-u` will pull the last (local) version of the dependencies (so the last version of the Flux extensions). See [here](#using-a-local-build-of-another-extension)
2. Before to do any MR (this repo or Flux), please run the tests of each repo `repo.bat test`
3. When all the test pass (Flux and LSS), do your Flux MR.
4. When approved, merge your Flux MR.
5. Wait for the Flux extensions to be published (please check the pipeline of the Flux repo)
6. (optional) Delete your `user.toml` from [here](#using-a-local-build-of-another-extension)
7. Build project: `build.bat -r -u`. It will grab the published extensions.
8. Do your LSS MR.

> :warning: **Please don't wait days to merge your LSS MR. Doing this will affect others LSS MRs (they will pull your Flux extensions) **


##### Commonly-Used Flags

- Disable Sentry for local development *(Avoid creating Sentry tickets when working on bugs or features)*:
  - `--/telemetry/enableSentry=false`
- Disable Driver-Version check *(Avoid Kit crashing on startup when an unsupported driver version is detected)*
  - `--/rtx/verifyDriverVersion/enabled=false`
- Enable the PyCharm Debugger *(See the [PYCHARM_GUIDE](PYCHARM_GUIDE.md) for more details)*:
  - `--/app/extensions/registryEnabled=1 `
  - `--enable omni.kit.debug.pycharm`
  - `--/exts/omni.kit.debug.pycharm/pycharm_location="C:\Program Files\JetBrains\PyCharm 2023.2"` *(The file path should be modified to point to your PyCharm Installation)*

## Developer Guides

## Publishing a new App Version to the OV Launcher

To bump the RTX Remix app version number, there are 3 files that need to be updated.
***Attempts to publish to the OV launcher without first making sure that these***
***files are properly updated will result cause incorrect versions to be displayed,***
***or will cause the pipeline to outright fail.***

The files that need to be updated are outlined below:

```
  ./launcher.toml
    #displayed before application name in launcher
    productArea = "Omniverse"
    version = "2022.X.X"

  ./VERSION.md
    2022.X.X

  ./source/apps/omni.app.lightspeed.kit
    title = "Lightspeed Kit"
    description = "Used for lightspeed remastering."
    version = "2022.X.X"
```

Once these files have been updated and your merge request has been approved and merged
to master, a quick check/build/test pipeline will run.

After the check/build/test pipeline completes and you are ready to publish the new version,
click the play button for the manual job that was created after your MR was merged.

This will create a new branch and pipeline in the **[trex-release-pipeline](https://gitlab-master.nvidia.com/omniverse/trex-release-pipeline/-/pipelines)** project.

The publish process takes about ~20 minutes as Aug 2022.

Please make sure to test the new version by downloading it from the internal OV launcher.

### Releasing to the public OV Launcher

Once QA has tested and approved an internal build we are ready to push it out to the world.
1. Create a new branch in [trex-release-pipeline](https://gitlab-master.nvidia.com/omniverse/trex-release-pipeline/-/pipelines) starting with `PROD-` and the same version. (i.e. `PROD-2024.3.0-RC.3` for `INTEG-2024.3.0-RC.3`)
1. Switch to that branch in gitlab and "Run Pipeline".
1. The first run will fail but search the error logs for the JIRA ticket that was created.
1. When you approve that JIRA ticket and type "Approved" it will retry the pipeline and
this time it should succeed. That means that the build is available for download on the
public OV Launcher.

# Kit Extensions & Apps Example :package:

This repo is the gold standard for building Kit extensions and applications.

The idea is that you fork it, trim down parts you don't need and use it to develop your extensions and applications. Which then can be packaged, shared, reused.

This README file provides a quick overview.  In-depth documentation can be found at:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ðŸ“– http://omniverse-docs.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/kit-template

[Teamcity Project](https://teamcity.nvidia.com/project/Omniverse_KitExtensions_KitTemplate?mode=builds)


## Using a Local Build of Kit SDK

By default packman downloads Kit SDK ([target-deps.packman.xml](deps/target-deps.packman.xml)). For developing purposes local build of Kit SDK can be used.

To use your local build of Kit SDK, assuming it is located say at `C:/projects/kit`.

Use `repo_source` tool to link:

> `repo source link kit-sdk c:/projects/kit/kit`

Or use GUI mode to do source linking:

> `repo source gui`

Or you can also do it manually: create a file: `deps/target-deps.packman.xml.user` containing the following lines:

```xml
<project toolsVersion="5.6">
	<dependency name="kit_sdk_${config}" linkPath="../_build/${platform}/${config}/kit">
		<source path="c:/projects/kit/kit/_build/$platform/$config" />
	</dependency>
</project>
```

To see current source links:

> `repo source list`

To remove source link:

> `repo source unlink kit-sdk`

To remove all source links:

> `repo source clear`


## Using a Local Build of another Extension

Other extensions can often come from the registry to be downloaded by kit at run-time or build-time (e.g. `omni.app.precache_exts_demo.kit` example). Developers often want to use local clone of their repo to develop across multiple repo simultaneously.

To do that additional extension search path needs to be passed into kit pointing to the local repo. There are many ways to do it. Recommended is using `deps/user.toml`. You can use that file to override any setting.

Create `deps/user.toml` file in this repo with the search to path to your repo added to `app/exts/folders` setting, e.g.:

```toml
[app.exts]
folders."++" = ["c:/projects/extensions/kit-converters/_build/windows-x86_64/release/exts"]
```

Other options:
* Pass CLI arg to any app like this: `--ext-folder c:/projects/extensions/kit-converters/_build/windows-x86_64/release/exts`.
* Use _Extension Manager UI (Gear button)_
* Use other `user.toml` files, refer to [Kit Documentation: Configuration](http://omnidocs-internal.nvidia.com/py/docs/guide/configuration.html#user-settings).

You can always find out where extension is coming from in _Extension Manager_ by selecting an extension and hovering over open button or in the log (search for e.g. `[ext: omni.kit.tool.asset_importer`).

## RTX Remix Documentation
The user facing [documentation](https://docs.omniverse.nvidia.com/kit/docs/rtx_remix/latest/) can be found in `.\docs` and the sidebar is configured in `.\index.md`.

Any changes to the docs on the `master` branch of our project will go live after
the `build_docs` job finishes and the aws caching refreshes.

### Building Documentation Locally
When modifying the user-facing documentation, it is a good idea to preview how it will actually look in a browser for the public. Luckily that's easy to do!

Navigate to the root of this repository and run:
 ```bat
 .\repo docs --warn-as-error=0 --project rtx_remix
 ```

It will print the following, and you can open the file:// link in your favorite browser.
```bat
The HTML pages are in _build\docs\rtx_remix\latest.
Wrote: file://C:/Users/nkendallbar/projects/lightspeed-kit/_build/docs/rtx_remix/latest/index.html
```

More details can be found in the [omni-docs wiki](https://gitlab-master.nvidia.com/omniverse/omni-docs/-/wikis/Building-Omnidocs). They use the same tools, but be
aware that those instructions may be specific to the omni-docs project.

### Preview Markdown documentation with PyCharm
Another useful way to get quick feedback is to use **PyCharm's Markdown** plugin. You can
edit the raw text and see the markdown update live. Just go to `Settings > Plugins` and
search for `"Markdown"` to install it. Note that you won't be able to preview everything
perfectly (like sphinx's Table of Contents `toctree`s) so it's still important to build
the docs as the final check.


## Tips for Adding to README

If you add a new MD file, please also add it to the `sphinx_exclude_patterns` in `repo.toml`.  Otherwise the doc builder will complain.
