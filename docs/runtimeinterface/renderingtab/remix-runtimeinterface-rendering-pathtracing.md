Additionally, unordered approximations will only be done on the first indirect ray bounce (as particles matter less in higher bounces), and only if enabled by its corresponding setting.

<p>
This is usually useful to have enabled as it will ensure useless paths are terminated earlier while more important paths are allowed to accumulate more bounces.
<p>
Furthermore this allows for the renderer to remain unbiased whereas a hard clamp on the number of bounces will introduce bias (though this is also done in Remix for the sake of performance).
<p>
On the other hand, randomly terminating paths too aggressively may leave threads in GPU warps without work which may hurt thread occupancy when not used with a thread-reordering technique like SER.

   </td>
   <td>Checked
   </td>
   <td>A flag to enable or disable screen-space probability dithering on the first indirect lobe sampled.
<p>
Generally sampling a diffuse, specular or other lobe relies on a random number generated against the probability of sampling each lobe, effectively focusing more rays/paths on lobes which matter more.
<p>
This can cause issues however with denoisers which do not handle sparse stochastic signals (like those from path tracing) well as they may be expecting a more "complete" signal like those used in simpler branching ray tracing setups.
<p>
To help solve this issue this option uses a temporal screen space dithering based on the probability rather than a purely random choice to determine which lobe to sample from on the first indirect bounce.
<p>
This as a result helps ensure there will always be a diffuse or specular sample within the dithering pattern's area and should help the denoising resolve a more stable result.

<p>
This allows for the presence of unordered approximations in resolving to be overridden in indirect rays and as such requires separate unordered approximations to be enabled to have any effect.
<p>
This option should be enabled if objects which can be resolvered in an unordered way in indirect rays are expected for higher quality in reflections, but may come at a performance cost.
<p>
Note that even with this option enabled, unordered resolve approximations are only done on the first indirect bounce for the sake of performance overall.

   <td>Textures on draw calls that are already particles or emissivity blended and have beam-like geometry.
<p>
Typically objects marked as particles or objects using emissive blending will be rendered with a special method which allows re-orientation of the billboard geometry assumed to make up the draw call in indirect rays (reflections for example).
<p>
This method works fine for typical particles, but some (e.g. a laser beam) may not be well-represented with the typical billboard assumption of simply needing to rotate around its centroid to face the view direction.
<p>
To handle such cases a different beam mode is used to treat objects as more of a cylindrical beam and re-orient around its main spanning axis, allowing for better rendering of these beam-like effect objects.

Higher values result in better indirect lighting quality due to biasing the signal less, lower values result in better performance.

Very high values are not recommended however as while long paths may be technically needed for unbiased rendering, in practice the contributions from higher bounces have diminishing returns.

   <td>A tuning factor applied to the spread angle calculated from the sampled lobe solid angle PDF. Should be 0-1.
<p>
This scaled spread angle is used to widen a ray's cone angle after indirect lighting BRDF samples to essentially prefilter the effects of the BRDF lobe's spread which potentially may reduce noise from indirect rays (e.g. reflections).
<p>
Prefiltering will overblur detail however compared to the ground truth of casting multiple samples especially given this calculated spread angle is a basic approximation and ray cones to begin with are a simple approximation for ray pixel footprint.
<p>
As such rather than using the spread angle fully this spread angle factor allows it to be scaled down to something more narrow so that overblurring can be minimized. Similarly, setting this factor to 0 disables this cone angle widening feature.
