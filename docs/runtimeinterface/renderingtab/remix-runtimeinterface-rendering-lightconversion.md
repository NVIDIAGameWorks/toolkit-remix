# Light Conversion

Light Conversion allows you to control how game lights are translated into Path Tracing compatible physical light sources in the Remix Toolkit.

   </td>
   <td>Enable usage of least squares for approximating a light's falloff curve rather than a more basic single point approach. This will generally result in more accurate matching of the original application's custom light attenuation curves, especially with non physically based linear-style attenuation.

   <td>The fixed radius in world units to use for legacy lights converted to sphere lights (currently point and spot lights will convert to sphere lights). Use caution with large light radii as many legacy lights will be placed close to geometry and intersect it, causing suboptimal light sampling performance or other visual artifacts (lights clipping through walls, etc).
