# Volumetrics

Volumetrics allows you to adjust everything related to the volumetric fog in Remix. You can also turn the volumetric fog
off or on via the Enable Volumetric Lighting Checkbox. Turning on “Enable Legacy Fog Remapping” will allow the
volumetric fog to take in information from the legacy fog in the game and attempt to match its look.
