# Volumetrics

Volumetrics allows you to adjust everything related to the volumetric fog in Remix. You can also turn the volumetric fog off or on via the Enable Volumetric Lighting Checkbox. Turning on “Enable Legacy Fog Remapping” will allow the volumetric fog to take in information from the legacy fog in the game and attempt to match its look.

Large values result in greater image stability at the cost of potentially more temporal lag.Should generally be set to as large a value as is viable as the froxel radiance cache is assumed to be fairly noise-free and stable which temporal accumulation helps with.

<p>
Note that enabling this option will require 3x the memory of the typical froxel grid as well as degrade performance in some cases.
<p>
This option should be enabled always in games using ray portals for proper looking volumetrics through them, but should be disabled on any game not using ray portals.
<p>
Additionally, this setting must be set at startup and changing it will not take effect at runtime.

This should generally be enabled but currently due to the lack of temporal bias correction this option will slightly bias the lighting result.

When enabled this option allows for remapping of fixed function fog parameters from the game to volumetric parameters to accommodate this dynamic need.
