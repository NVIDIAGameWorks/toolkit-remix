This mapping allows for realistic and detailed texturing of 3D objects, enabling the application of textures like color, bump maps, normal maps, and more. By specifying texture coordinates for each vertex, the graphics hardware can interpolate and apply the corresponding texture data smoothly across the entire surface, creating the illusion of complex surface properties and details on the 3D object when rendered.

  <tr>
   <td>Anisotropic Roughness
   </td>

   <td>Pixel Checkerboard

   <td>A technique used to analyze and visualize the distribution of pixel shading workloads across the screen or image.
