| Primitive Index                                                       | Refers to a unique identifier or index associated with a primitive in a rendering or graphics pipeline. Primitives are fundamental geometric shapes or elements used in computer graphics to construct more complex scenes and objects. These primitives can include points, lines, triangles, and more. Each primitive is assigned a unique index that allows the GPU to process them individually or in specific groups as required by the rendering algorithm.                                                                                      |

| Barycentric Coordinates                                               | A set of coordinates used to describe the position of a point within a triangle or other convex polygon. These coordinates are defined relative to the vertices of the polygon and are useful for various operations in graphics rendering, including interpolation and texture mapping. Barycentric coordinates are represented as a set of weights for each vertex of the polygon.                                                                                                                                                                   |

| Secondary Ray Bounces                                                 | Refers to the rays that are cast after the primary rays during the ray tracing process. Primary rays are initially shot from the camera or viewer into the 3D scene to determine which objects or surfaces are visible. When these primary rays hit a reflective or refractive surface, secondary rays are generated to simulate additional lighting effects, such as reflections and refractions.                                                                                                                                                     |
