| 12      | Pathtracing                           | Pathtracing allows you to tweak the behavior of the Path Tracer in both subtle and profound ways. The technical details go deep into Ray Tracing theory                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 13      | Lighting                              | Lighting allows you to adjust global lighting intensity and other parameters, as well as go deep under the hood of two of the core lighting algorithms used by the Remix Path Tracing renderer: RTXDI and ReSTIR GI. You can read more about each technology.                                                                                                   |
| 14      | Volumetrics                           | Volumetrics allows you to adjust everything related to the volumetric fog in Remix. You can also turn the volumetric fog off or on via the Enable Volumetric Lighting Checkbox. Turning on "Enable Legacy Fog Remapping" will allow the volumetric fog to take in information from the legacy fog in the game and attempt to match its look.                    |
| 15      | Alpha Test / Blending                 | Alpha Test / Blending allows you to toggle alpha testing and blending in the Remix Toolkit.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 16      | Denoising                             | Denoising allows you to toggle denoising on and off, as well as tune denoising parameters in detail. Denoising is a critical part of modern Path Tracing renderers and turning it off entirely has mainly educational value. Adjusting the individual settings may be beneficial for image quality or compatibility, depending on the game and mod in question. |
| 17      | Post-Processing                       | Post-Processing allows you to toggle on and off, as well as tune the look of each of the supported post-processing effects in Remix.                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
