RTX Remix comes with a runtime overlay menu that makes it easy to adjust how your game looks and runs. It contains detailed settings for all the major functions: Rendering, Asset Replacement, and Capture. You can access this menu by pressing **Alt + X** once in game (this hotkey can also be customized using the rtx.conf config file).
