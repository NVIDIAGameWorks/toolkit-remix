# Runtime User Guide

RTX Remix comes with a runtime overlay menu containing detailed settings for all the major functions: Rendering, Asset Replacement, and Capture. You can access this menu by pressing **Alt + X** once in game (this hotkey can also be customized using the rtx.conf config file).

When pressing **Alt + X**, you will first be taken to the User Graphics Settings menu. This menu has various high-level settings intended for end users of RTX Remix mods to quickly customize their experience. There are three tabs: General, Rendering and Content. All the settings are described with a tooltip when you hover over them.

The General settings deal mostly with performance and include various upscaling and latency reduction options.

The Rendering settings contain high level image quality settings for the RTX Remix Path Tracing renderer. You can select one of the provided presets or customize each individual setting.

The Content settings allow you to turn off and on each of the three types of replacements supported by RTX Remix: Material, Mesh and Light replacements. These settings can be of interest when you want to evaluate the impact of each type of replacement on the mod project. Note however, that turning all the replacements off does not mean reverting to the original rendering that the underlying game uses. You are still Path Tracing, just with global defaults in place for materials and lights, and without any replacement meshes.

At the bottom of the User Graphics Settings menu, you should see a button for Developer Settings Menu. This will take you to a deeper and more detailed RTX Remix Developer Menu. It contains three main tabs. 
1. The **Rendering tab** is intended mostly for mod authors and runtime developers who need the ultimate control of renderer internals to achieve compatibility or the intended look for a mod or game. 
1. The **Game Setup tab** contains the key capture and tagging workflow that will be needed to make a game moddable and compatible with RTX Remix. 
1. The **Enhancements tab** allows for toggling various types of replacements on and off, as well as highlighting unreplaced assets, all useful for testing and validating mod content.

> üìù There is a checkbox at the top of the Developer Settings Menu that says "Always Developer Menu." Turning this checkbox on (and saving settings) will take you directly to the Developer menu when pressing **Alt + X**, saving you a click!

The **Rendering tab** in the Developer Settings Menu allows you to customize the Remix Path Tracing renderer. You can change options for upscaling, path tracing and lighting. Every option here has a corresponding setting in the **rtx.conf** file. You can view detailed documentation on all these options in the section on config files below.

Any settings you change in the menus can be saved as new defaults. They will be stored in a file named **rtx.conf** placed next to the **.trex/ runtime** folder. This file will be created if it does not already exist. The next time you start the game with RTX Remix, settings will be read from this file, and applied automatically.

> üìù You can extend or shrink the Menu panel by holding your mouse cursor over the edge of the panels until the icon changes to the double arrow icon, then drag the edge of the panel to the size you prefer.


## RTX Runtime Interface

RTX Remix makes it easy to adjust how your game looks and runs. To access these settings while playing the game, press **Alt + X** (you can also change this shortcut in the rtx.conf config file).

When you press **Alt + X**, you'll see the User Graphics Settings menu. This menu is designed for regular players who want to quickly change how their RTX Remix mods appear. It has three tabs: General, Rendering, and Content. If you're not sure what a setting does, just hover your mouse over it, and a tooltip will explain.

At the bottom of the User Graphics Settings menu, there's a button for the Developer Settings Menu. This takes you to an even more detailed menu for advanced users. It has three main tabs: Rendering (for mod creators and developers who want full control), Game Setup (important for making games work with RTX Remix), and Enhancements (for testing and improving mod content).

Any changes you make in these menus can be saved as new defaults. They're stored in a file called rtx.conf, which goes in the same folder as the runtime. If this file doesn't exist, RTX Remix will create it. Next time you play with RTX Remix, it will use these saved settings automatically.

This is typically used to reduce flickering artifacts resulting from reflection on surfaces like glass leveraging normal maps as often the denoiser is too aggressive with disocclusion checks frame to frame when DLSS or other camera jittering is in use.

<p>
Normal detail is defined as 1-dot(tangent_normal, vec3(0, 0, 1)), or in other words it is 0 when no normal mapping is used, and 1 when the normal mapped normal is perpendicular to the underlying normal.
<p>
This is typically used to reduce flickering artifacts resulting from refraction on surfaces like glass leveraging normal maps as often the denoiser is too aggressive with disocclusion checks frame to frame when DLSS or other camera jittering is in use.

   <td>A flag to enable or disable Russian Roulette, a rendering technique to give paths a chance of terminating randomly with each bounce based on their importance.
<p>
This is usually useful to have enabled as it will ensure useless paths are terminated earlier while more important paths are allowed to accumulate more bounces.
<p>
Furthermore this allows for the renderer to remain unbiased whereas a hard clamp on the number of bounces will introduce bias (though this is also done in Remix for the sake of performance).
<p>
On the other hand, randomly terminating paths too aggressively may leave threads in GPU warps without work which may hurt thread occupancy when not used with a thread-reordering technique like SER.

   </td>
   <td>A flag to enable or disable screen-space probability dithering on the first indirect lobe sampled.
<p>
Generally sampling a diffuse, specular or other lobe relies on a random number generated against the probability of sampling each lobe, effectively focusing more rays/paths on lobes which matter more.
<p>
This can cause issues however with denoisers which do not handle sparse stochastic signals (like those from path tracing) well as they may be expecting a more "complete" signal like those used in simpler branching ray tracing setups.
<p>
To help solve this issue this option uses a temporal screen space dithering based on the probability rather than a purely random choice to determine which lobe to sample from on the first indirect bounce.
<p>
This as a result helps ensure there will always be a diffuse or specular sample within the dithering pattern's area and should help the denoising resolve a more stable result.

<p>
This allows for the presence of unordered approximations in resolving to be overridden in indirect rays and as such requires separate unordered approximations to be enabled to have any effect.
<p>
This option should be enabled if objects which can be resolvered in an unordered way in indirect rays are expected for higher quality in reflections, but may come at a performance cost.
<p>
Note that even with this option enabled, unordered resolve approximations are only done on the first indirect bounce for the sake of performance overall.

<p>
Typically objects marked as particles or objects using emissive blending will be rendered with a special method which allows re-orientation of the billboard geometry assumed to make up the draw call in indirect rays (reflections for example).
<p>
This method works fine for typical particles, but some (e.g. a laser beam) may not be well-represented with the typical billboard assumption of simply needing to rotate around its centroid to face the view direction.
<p>
To handle such cases a different beam mode is used to treat objects as more of a cylindrical beam and re-orient around its main spanning axis, allowing for better rendering of these beam-like effect objects.

Higher values result in better indirect lighting quality due to biasing the signal less, lower values result in better performance.

Very high values are not recommended however as while long paths may be technically needed for unbiased rendering, in practice the contributions from higher bounces have diminishing returns.

<p>
This scaled spread angle is used to widen a ray's cone angle after indirect lighting BRDF samples to essentially prefilter the effects of the BRDF lobe's spread which potentially may reduce noise from indirect rays (e.g. reflections).
<p>
Prefiltering will overblur detail however compared to the ground truth of casting multiple samples especially given this calculated spread angle is a basic approximation and ray cones to begin with are a simple approximation for ray pixel footprint.
<p>
As such rather than using the spread angle fully this spread angle factor allows it to be scaled down to something more narrow so that overblurring can be minimized. Similarly, setting this factor to 0 disables this cone angle widening feature.

#### Volumetrics

Volumetrics allows you to adjust everything related to the volumetric fog in Remix. You can also turn the volumetric fog off or on via the Enable Volumetric Lighting Checkbox. Turning on ‚ÄúEnable Legacy Fog Remapping‚Äù will allow the volumetric fog to take in information from the legacy fog in the game and attempt to match its look.

   <td>A flag to enable or disable fixed function fog remapping. Only takes effect when volumetrics are enabled.
<p>
Typically many old games used fixed function fog for various effects and while sometimes this fog can be replaced with proper volumetrics globally, other times require some amount of dynamic behavior controlled by the game.
<p>
When enabled this option allows for remapping of fixed function fog parameters from the game to volumetric parameters to accommodate this dynamic need.

#### Denoising

Denoising allows you to toggle denoising on and off, as well as tune denoising parameters in detail. Denoising is a critical part of modern Path Tracing renderers and turning it off entirely has mainly educational value. Adjusting the individual settings may be beneficial for image quality or compatibility, depending on the game and mod in question.

   <td>Enables usage of denoiser(s) when set to true, otherwise disables denoising when set to false.
<p>
Denoising is important for filtering the raw noisy ray traced signal into a smoother and more stable result at the cost of some potential spatial/temporal artifacts (ghosting, boiling, blurring, etc).
<p>
Generally should remain enabled except when debugging behavior which requires investigating the output directly, or diagnosing denoising-related issues.

   </td>
   <td>Enables the reference "denoiser" when set to true, otherwise uses the standard denoiser when set to false. Note this requires the denoiser to be enabled to function.
<p>
The reference denoiser allows for a reference multi-sample per pixel contribution to accumulate which should converge slowly to the ideal result the renderer is working towards.
<p>
Useful for analyzing quality differences in various denoising methods, post-processing filters, or for more accurately comparing subtle effects of potentially biased rendering techniques which may be hard to see through usual noise and filtering.
<p>
Also useful for higher quality artistic renders of a scene beyond what is possible in real time.

   <td>A flag to enable or disable the usage of virtual shading normals for denoising passes.
<p>
This is primarily important for anything that modifies the direction of a primary ray, so mainly PSR and ray portals as both of these will view a surface from an angle different from the "virtual" viewing direction perceived by the camera.
<p>
This can cause some issues with denoising due to the normals not matching the expected perception of what the normals should be, for example normals facing away from the camera direction due to being viewed from a different angle via refraction or portal teleportation.
<p>
To correct this, virtual normals are calculated such that they always are oriented relative to the primary camera ray as if its direction was never altered, matching the virtual perception of the surface from the camera's point of view.
<p>
As an aside, virtual normals themselves can cause issues with denoising due to the normals suddenly changing from virtual to "real" normals upon traveling through a portal, causing surface consistency failures in the denoiser, but this is accounted for via a special transform given to the denoiser on camera ray portal teleportation events.
<p>
As such, this option should generally always be enabled when rendering with ray portals in the scene to have good denoising quality.

This mapping allows for realistic and detailed texturing of 3D objects, enabling the application of textures like color, bump maps, normal maps, and more. By specifying texture coordinates for each vertex, the graphics hardware can interpolate and apply the corresponding texture data smoothly across the entire surface, creating the illusion of complex surface properties and details on the 3D object when rendered.

### Enhancements Tab

The Enhancements tab allows you to review the impact and extent of replacements in the active mod. Remix mods can replace virtually any mesh, texture or light in the modded game, and this menu allows you to toggle these enhancements on and off at will to help compare with unmodded assets.

The Enhancements tab also contains the all-important Capture Frame in USD button, at the top. Clicking on this button will create a capture of the game world in that location and point of time and store it in USD format on disk. These captures are the basis of all remastering work in the Remix App, where you can replace materials, meshes and lights with physically correct modern equivalents.

When enabled, this mode allows replacement textures to load in only up to an adaptive minimum mip level to cut down on memory usage, but only when forced high resolution replacement textures is disabled.

This should generally always be enabled to ensure Remix does not starve the system of CPU or GPU memory while loading textures.
<p>
Additionally, this setting must be set at startup and changing it will not take effect at runtime.

This minimum will always be considered as long as force high resolution replacement textures is not enabled, meaning that with or without adaptive resolution replacement textures enabled this setting will always enforce a minimum mipmap restriction.
<p>
Generally this should be changed to reduce the texture quality globally if desired to reduce CPU and GPU memory usage and typically should be controlled by some sort of texture quality setting.

Additionally, this setting must be set at startup and changing it will not take effect at runtime.

When enabled this mode overrides all other methods of mip calculation (adaptive resolution and the minimum mipmap level) and forces it to be 0 to always load in the highest quality of textures.
<p>
This generally should not be used other than for various forms of debugging or visual comparisons as this mode will ignore any constraints on CPU or GPU memory which may starve the system or Remix of memory.

Additionally, this setting must be set at startup and changing it will not take effect at runtime.
