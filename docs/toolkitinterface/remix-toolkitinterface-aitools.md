| Ref   | Option                   | Description |
| :---: | :----------------------- | :----------- |
| 1     | Context                  | texturecraft |
| 2     | Input File Paths         | The list of files to import.  <p>The texture type is determined by analyzing the name of the texture file.  When there are different possible texture types in one file name, the tool prioritizes the last one it finds.  For instance, if a texture fiel is called 'T_Metal_01_Normal.png', the tool will pick 'Normal' as the texture type, even though there are other options ('Metal') in the name.  If the Tool picks the wrong texture type, you can fix it by choosing the correct texture type from the dropdown corresponding to teh given texture file.  To see examples of names the tool looks for each texture type, however your mouse over the texture type dropdowns.  NOTE: There must be at least one file in the list for it to be valid.</p> |
| 3     | Convention               | The default type for normals in this texture batch. <p>The application creating normal maps usually specifies the convention. Selecting incorrectly may result in indentations instead of bumps on applied meshes.</p> <p>Options Include: Normal - OpenGL, Normal - DirectX, Normal - Octahedral</p> |
