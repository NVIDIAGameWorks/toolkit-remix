# Glossary of Terms

**.exe file** - An ".exe" file, short for "executable," is a common file extension used in Windows operating systems and some other computing environments. An executable file contains a program or application that can be run or executed by a computer's operating system. 

**.usd** - Universal Scene Description (Binary) This is the standard binary or ASCII file format for USD. It stores the 3D scene and asset data in a compact, binary form, making it efficient for storage and processing.

**.usda** - Universal Scene Description (ASCII) This format stores USD data in a human-readable, ASCII text format. It's primarily used for debugging and as a reference because it's easier for humans to read and modify. However, it's less efficient in terms of file size and loading speed compared to the binary format.

**.usdc** - Universal Scene Description (Crate) This is a binary format for USD, but it's optimized for high-performance data storage and retrieval. .usdc files are typically used as the primary format for asset storage and production pipelines, as they offer faster loading and saving times compared to .usd files.

**.usdz** - Universal Scene Description (ZIP) A compressed container file in the ZIP structure that can contain both geometry and texture information.


## A

**Anisotropic Roughness** - Refers to a property that describes surface roughness in a way that varies based on the direction of measurement. Unlike isotropic roughness, which is uniform in all directions, anisotropic roughness implies that the micro-surface irregularities on an object's surface have a directional preference.

**Anisotropy** - Refers to a property of materials or surfaces that causes them to exhibit different reflective or shading characteristics in different directions. Anisotropic materials have a direction-dependent behavior, meaning they can appear shinier or more reflective in one direction while exhibiting different properties in other directions.


## B

Primary rays are initially shot from the camera or viewer into the 3D scene to determine which objects or surfaces are visible. When these primary rays hit a reflective or refractive surface, secondary rays are generated to simulate additional lighting effects, such as reflections and refractions.

**Secondary Specular Albedo** - Refers to the albedo or reflectance value that represents the color and intensity of the secondary, or indirect, specular reflections on a surface when using ray tracing or other advanced rendering techniques.

**Shading Normal** - Often referred to as a "Geometric Normal," is a vector that represents the orientation or facing direction of a surface at a particular point on a 3D object. This vector is used in shading calculations to determine how light interacts with the surface and how the surface should be illuminated or shaded.

[**SIGMA**](https://developer.nvidia.com/rtx/ray-tracing/rt-denoisers) - SIGMA is a fast shadow denoiser. It supports shadows from any type of light sources, like the sun and local lights. SIGMA relies more on physically based spatial filtering than temporal filtering, offering minimal temporal lag.

**Stochastic Texture Filtering (STF)** - often referred to as stochastic texture synthesis or stochastic texture generation, is a technique used in computer graphics and computer vision to create realistic and natural-looking textures. The term "stochastic" refers to randomness or unpredictability, and in this context, it involves introducing controlled randomness into the generation of textures to make them appear more natural and less repetitive.

This mapping allows for realistic and detailed texturing of 3D objects, enabling the application of textures like color, bump maps, normal maps, and more. By specifying texture coordinates for each vertex, the graphics hardware can interpolate and apply the corresponding texture data smoothly across the entire surface, creating the illusion of complex surface properties and details on the 3D object when rendered.
