.exe
    An ".exe" file, short for "executable," is a common file extension in Windows operating systems and some other
    computing environments. An executable file contains a program or application that can be run or executed by a computer's
    operating system.

.usd
    Universal Scene Description (Binary): This is the standard binary file format for USD. It stores the 3D scene and asset
    data in a compact, binary form, making it efficient for storage and processing.

.usda
    Universal Scene Description (ASCII): This format stores USD data in a human-readable, ASCII text format. It's primarily
    used for debugging and as a reference because it's easier for humans to read and modify. However, it's less efficient
    in terms of file size and loading speed compared to the binary format.

.usdc
    Universal Scene Description (Crate): This is a binary format for USD, optimized for high-performance data storage and
    retrieval. .usdc files are typically used as the primary format for asset storage and production pipelines, offering
    faster loading and saving times compared to .usd files.

.usdz
    Universal Scene Description (ZIP): A compressed container file in the ZIP format that can contain both geometry and
    texture information.

Anisotropic Roughness
    This term describes surface roughness that varies based on the direction of measurement. Unlike isotropic roughness,
    which is uniform in all directions, anisotropic roughness indicates that the micro-surface irregularities on an object's
    surface have a directional preference.

Anisotropy
    This refers to a property of materials or surfaces that causes them to exhibit different reflective or shading
    characteristics in different directions. Anisotropic materials have direction-dependent behavior, appearing shinier or
    more reflective in one direction while exhibiting different properties in other directions.

Barycentric Coordinates
    These are a set of coordinates used to describe the position of a point within a triangle or other convex polygon.
    Defined relative to the vertices of the polygon, these coordinates are useful for various operations in graphics
    rendering, including interpolation and texture mapping. Barycentric coordinates are represented as a set of weights for
    each vertex of the polygon.

Bitangent
    This is a vector that is perpendicular to both the surface normal and the tangent vector of a 3D surface at a particular
    point. Bitangent vectors are typically used in advanced shading techniques, such as normal mapping and bump mapping, to
    complete a local coordinate system known as the tangent space.

Blue Noise
    This refers to a type of noise pattern with unique properties that make it useful for various applications, including
    texture mapping, sampling, and anti-aliasing. Blue noise is characterized by a distribution of points or values that are
    more evenly spaced and have a more perceptually uniform distribution of energy in the high-frequency spectrum, especially
    in the "blue" region of the spectrum.

Composite Output
    This refers to the final image generated by combining and blending various graphical elements or layers. This process
    typically involves taking multiple rendered images, often with transparency information, and compositing them into a
    single cohesive image representing the final scene as it will be displayed to the viewer.

Cone Radius
    This refers to the radius of the cone shape used to represent the path of a ray of light as it extends from the camera
    into the scene. It helps determine which objects or surfaces in the 3D environment the ray intersects.

DDS File
    DDS stands for "DirectDraw Surface." It is a file format commonly used in computer graphics and game development,
    specifically designed for storing and efficiently accessing texture and image data.

Diffuse Albedo
    This refers to the inherent color or reflectance of a surface when it interacts with and scatters incoming light uniformly
    in all directions. It represents the base color of a surface under diffuse lighting conditions, where there are no
    specular highlights or reflections.

Disocclusion
    This refers to the process of determining what is visible and what is not in a 3D scene from a given viewpoint. It
    primarily relates to the handling of objects, surfaces, or portions of objects that were previously hidden or occluded
    by other objects but have become visible due to changes in the camera's position or orientation.

DLSS
    NVIDIA DLSS (Deep Learning Super Sampling) is a neural graphics technology that enhances performance by using AI to
    create entirely new frames and display higher resolution through image reconstruction. It aims to deliver high-quality
    images and responsiveness.

Emissive Radiance
    This refers to the radiant energy emitted from a surface or object in a 3D scene. It represents the light or color that
    a surface emits, as opposed to reflecting or scattering light like most materials.

Exposure Histogram
    This is a graphical representation that provides a visual summary of the distribution of pixel brightness or luminance
    values in an image. It shows how many pixels fall into different brightness or exposure levels, typically displayed as
    a histogram chart.

Froxel
    This is a portmanteau of "fragment" and "voxel" used in computer graphics. It represents a small 3D volume element or
    pixel-sized voxel within a three-dimensional space. Froxels are typically used in volume rendering and ray tracing
    techniques to sample and process data within a 3D volume, similar to how pixels sample a 2D image.

HitT
    Hit-Testing (also called hit detection, picking, or pick correlation) is the process of determining whether a
    user-controlled cursor (such as a mouse cursor or touch-point on a touch-screen interface) intersects a given shape,
    line, or curve drawn on the screen.

Inf/Nan Check
    This refers to a process or technique used to identify and handle numerical values that are either infinite (Inf) or
    not-a-number (NaN) during rendering or computation.

Interpolated Normal
    This is a normal vector calculated for a specific point on a 3D surface by interpolating or blending the normals of
    nearby vertices. Interpolated normals are used to determine how light interacts with the surface and are crucial for
    achieving smooth shading and realistic lighting effects.

Isotropic Roughness
    This refers to a property that describes the degree of micro-surface irregularities or roughness on a 3D object's
    surface in a uniform and non-directional manner. This roughness affects how light scatters and interacts with the
    surface, resulting in diffuse reflections.

Local Tonemapper Luminance Output
    This refers to the output of a local tonemapping process, which adjusts the brightness and contrast of an image on a
    pixel-by-pixel basis. This adjustment is based on the luminance or brightness values of the pixels in the image.

Material Type
    This refers to a classification or categorization of the physical properties and visual characteristics of surfaces or
    materials used in 3D scenes. Material types describe how light interacts with a particular surface and how it should
    be shaded and rendered. Common material types include diffuse materials, specular materials, translucent materials, and
    emissive materials.

Normals
    These are perpendicular vectors on the surfaces of 3D objects. They define the orientation of surfaces, play a key role
    in lighting calculations, and enable smooth shading by interpolating across polygon surfaces. Normals are fundamental
    for simulating how light interacts with objects and achieving realistic lighting and shading effects in 3D scenes.

NRD
    NVIDIA Real-Time Denoisers (NRD) is a spatio-temporal, API-agnostic denoising library designed to work with low
    ray-per-pixel signals. It uses input signals and environmental conditions to deliver results comparable to ground-truth
    images.

Octahedron-normal vectors
    These are a way to encode normals by projecting them onto an octahedron, folding it, and placing it on one square. This
    gives the normals uniform properties for value distribution and reduces encoding and decoding costs.

Opacity
    This refers to the degree to which an object or part of an object is transparent or allows light to pass through. It is
    a fundamental property used to control the visibility and transparency of 3D objects and their components within a
    rendered scene.

Pixel Checkerboard
    This is a technique used to analyze and visualize the distribution of pixel shading workloads across the screen or image.
    It involves rendering a checkerboard pattern over a scene, where each square of the checkerboard represents a pixel. The
    color of each square can indicate the complexity or computational workload of the corresponding pixel.

Primary Depth
    This refers to the depth information associated with the primary rays in a ray tracing pipeline.

Primary Ray Bounces
    This refers to the first set of rays cast from the camera or viewer into a 3D scene during the ray tracing process. These
    primary rays determine which objects or surfaces in the scene are visible from the camera's perspective.

Primary Specular Albedo
    This refers to the albedo or reflectance value that represents the color and intensity of specular reflections on a
    surface from direct light sources, such as point lights or directional lights, when using ray tracing or other rendering
    techniques.

Primitive Index
    This refers to a unique identifier or index assigned to a primitive in a rendering or graphics pipeline. Primitives are
    fundamental geometric shapes or elements used in computer graphics to construct more complex scenes and objects. These
    primitives can include points, lines, and triangles. Each primitive is assigned a unique index that allows the GPU to
    process them individually or in specific groups as required by the rendering algorithm.

ReBLUR
    This is a denoiser based on the idea of self-stabilizing, recurrent blurring. It's designed to work with diffuse and
    specular signals generated with low ray budgets. ReBLUR can support checkerboard rendering, producing reasonable results
    when casting just half a ray per pixel.

ReLAX
    This is a variant of SVGF optimized for denoising ray-traced specular and diffuse signals generated by NVIDIA RTX™ Direct
    Illumination (RTXDI). ReLAX improves image quality and performance over stock SVGF, preserving lighting details
    produced by RTXDI light counts and offering better temporal stability and responsiveness to changing lighting conditions.

ReSTIR Direct Illumination
    ReSTIR, or spatiotemporal reservoir resampling, samples one-bounce direct lighting from many lights without needing to
    maintain complex data. ReSTIR DI samples all primary lighting and shadows in screen space, significantly faster than
    previous solutions. This screen-space light sampling solution can handle a large number of lights with a small number
    of rays per pixel.

ReSTIR Global Illumination
    ReSTIR GI resamples multi-bounce indirect lighting paths. At a single sample per pixel every frame, this solution
    achieves a significant improvement in mean-square error (MSE). Combined with a denoiser, this offers high-quality path
    tracing at real-time frame rates.

RTX
    RTX represents real-time ray tracing, where the calculations required for ray tracing are performed in real-time,
    enabling lifelike graphics and dynamic lighting effects in video games and other applications.

RTXDI
    RTX Direct Illumination generates a large number of fully ray-traced dynamic lights, creating photorealistic lighting
    of scenes that require computing shadows from many area lights. This eliminates the need for baking lighting and using
    hero lights, unlocking creative freedom even with limited ray-per-pixel counts. When integrated with RTXGI and NVIDIA
    Real-Time Denoiser (NRD), scenes benefit from realistic and scalable ray-traced illumination and clean, denoised images,
    regardless of the environment.

RTXGI
    RTX Global Illumination enables multi-bounce indirect light without bake times, light leaks, or expensive per-frame
    costs. RTX Global Illumination (RTXGI) is a scalable solution that powers infinite bounce lighting in real time, even
    with strict frame budgets. This technology accelerates content creation with real-time in-engine lighting updates and
    supports a wide range of DirectX Raytracing (DXR)-enabled GPUs. RTXGI is designed to work in conjunction with RTX
    Direct Illumination (RTXDI) to create fully ray-traced scenes with a large number of dynamic light sources.

Screen-Space Motion Vector
    (SSMV) is a data representation that captures the motion of objects or pixels between consecutive frames within the
    screen space. SSMVs are used in various rendering techniques, such as motion blur and temporal anti-aliasing, to
    simulate realistic motion effects.

Secondary Ray Bounces
    These are the rays that are cast after the primary rays during the ray tracing process. Primary rays are initially shot
    from the camera or viewer into the 3D scene to determine which objects or surfaces are visible. When these primary rays
    hit a reflective or refractive surface, secondary rays are generated to simulate additional lighting effects, such as
    reflections and refractions.

Secondary Specular Albedo
    This refers to the albedo or reflectance value that represents the color and intensity of secondary, or indirect,
    specular reflections on a surface when using ray tracing or other advanced rendering techniques.

Shading Normal
    Often referred to as a "Geometric Normal," this is a vector that represents the orientation or facing direction of a
    surface at a particular point on a 3D object. The shading normal is used in shading calculations to determine how light
    interacts with the surface and how the surface should be illuminated or shaded.

SIGMA
    SIGMA is a fast shadow denoiser that supports shadows from various light sources. It relies more on spatial filtering
    than temporal filtering, resulting in minimal temporal lag.

Stochastic Texture Filtering
    Also known as stochastic texture synthesis or stochastic texture generation, this is a technique used in computer graphics
    and computer vision to create realistic and natural-looking textures. "Stochastic" refers to randomness, and in this
    context, it involves introducing controlled randomness into texture generation to make them appear more natural and less
    repetitive.

Tangent
    This refers to a vector that lies in the plane of a 3D surface and is perpendicular to the surface's normal vector.
    Tangent vectors are used in techniques like normal mapping and bump mapping to simulate fine surface details and enhance
    realism.

Texture Coordinates
    These coordinates specify which part of a 2D texture map should be applied to each point on a 3D model's surface. This
    mapping enables realistic and detailed texturing of 3D objects, allowing for the application of textures like color, bump
    maps, and normal maps. By specifying texture coordinates for each vertex, the graphics hardware can interpolate and
    apply the corresponding texture data smoothly across the entire surface, creating the illusion of complex surface
    properties and details on the rendered 3D object.

Thin Film Thickness
    This refers to the measurement of the thickness of a thin film or layer of material applied to a surface. This concept
    is used in computer graphics and rendering to simulate the interaction of light with thin layers of materials, such as
    oil films on water or soap bubbles.

Tonemapping
    This is a technique for converting high dynamic range (HDR) images or scenes into low dynamic range (LDR) images that can
    be displayed on screens, while preserving as much visual detail and realism as possible.

Triangle Normal
    These normals define the orientation of a triangle's surface. They help determine how light rays are reflected or
    refracted off the triangle's surface, affecting the appearance of the triangle in the rendered image.

UDIM
    UDIM (U Dimension) is a tile-based texture system where each tile represents a different texture in the overall UDIM
    texture array. Each tile has its own UV space and its own assigned image.

Vertex Color
    This refers to color information assigned to individual vertices (corner points) of a 3D model or object. Each vertex can
    have a specific color value, typically represented as a combination of red, green, and blue (RGB) values.

Virtual Motion Vector
    This refers to the motion of objects between frames. These motion vectors help reduce data redundancy and improve
    compression efficiency by describing how objects move from one frame to another.
