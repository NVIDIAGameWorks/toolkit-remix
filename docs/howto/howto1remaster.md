# Introduction to Remastering

Now that you've got everything set up, it's time to start remastering your game using Remix. The Remix runtime will automatically inject path tracing into the game, but the main focus of your Remix mod will be on replacing assets and textures. By using higher-poly models and PBR (Physically-Based Rendering) textures, you can significantly enhance the game's visual quality, surpassing what you could achieve with in-engine edits alone.
