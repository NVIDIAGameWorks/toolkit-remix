# Creating Remix Logic Graphs

```{warning}
This documentation is a work in progress.

## Overview

Remix Logic introduces a powerful paradigm to introduce a new layer of control for remix mods.

Once basic asset replacements have been done, Modders often want to make the replacement content react to the state of the game. The Remix Logic system provides a flexible way to sense what's happening in the game, make decisions based on that information, and then apply visual changes accordingly. This unlocks a whole new layer of dynamic visuals.
