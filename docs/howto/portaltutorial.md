# Tutorial: Remaster Portal using Portal RTX
To learn the process of setting up a game, here is an example of how to setup the RTX Remix Runtime for the Portal / Portal RTX.  This process **ONLY** works with source games. (These instructions also work with HL2.)

## Setup RTX Remix Runtime

1. **Game Installation:** Make sure you have both Portal and PortalRTX installed and fully updated.
2. **Backup CFG Folder:** Go to the **cfg** folder for Portal (common\Portal\portal\cfg) and rename it to something like "original-cfg." This way, you won't delete any of the existing data.
3. **Copy CFG Contents:** Copy all the files from the cfg folder of PortalRTX (common\PortalRTX\portal_rtx\cfg) and paste them into the cfg folder of Portal (common\Portal\portal\cfg).
4. **Backup BIN Folder:** Similarly, go to the bin folder for Portal (common\Portal\bin) and rename it to something like "original-bin" to preserve the data.
5. **Copy BIN Contents:** Copy all the files from the bin folder of PortalRTX (common\PortalRTX\bin) and paste them into the bin folder of Portal (common\Portal\bin).
6. **Copy Configuration Files:** Copy the files named **rtx.conf** and **dxvk.conf** from "common\PortalRTX" to "common\Portal"
7. **RTXRemix Application:** Extract the contents of the RTXRemix Application (latest version) to "common\Portal\bin," and overwrite any existing files if prompted.
8. **Launch the Game:** Launch the game from your Steam library.
9. **Console Variables (if needed):** Depending on your preferences, you may need to set certain console variables. These can also be set via the command line. Here they are:
    1. Set DirectX Level to v.7.0
    2. Set r_3dsky to 0
    3. Set viewmodel_fov to 90
    4. Set cl_first_person_uses_world_model to 0
    5. Steam Launch Options Example: -dxlevel 70 -r_3dsky 0 -viewmodel_fov 90 -cl_first_person_uses_world_model 0

## Setup Your Project Folder Structure

1. Create a "Projects" folder on your computer, outside of your game folder, to contain your game captures.
> ‚ö†Ô∏è Do not place your Projects folder inside of the captures folder generated by running the Remix Runtime.

2. Inside your Projects folder,
    1. Create an "Input" folder
    2. Create a Capture folder using the name of the capture you are taking.  _Example: Portal_

```text
Projects                <--- Manually create folder
|--- Input              <--- Manually create folder
|--- [GameTitle]        <--- Manually create folder
```

## Take Your First Scene Capture

1. Launch Portal, where you installed **RTX Runtime**.
2. Navigate to the first scene in the game and open the **Enhancements** tab of the Developer Settings Menu
    1. Option 1: Press **Alt + X** on your keyboard to open the RTX Runtime interface, click on the **Developer Settings Menu** button, then click on the **Enhancements** tab
    2. Option 2: Press **Ctrl + Shift + Q** on your keyboard to open the **Enhancements** Settings
3. If you don‚Äôt see the **Capture Frame in USD** button, uncheck the **Enable Enhanced Assets** checkbox to reveal it.
4. Click on the **Capture Frame in USD** button to capture the frame.
The file will be saved in the format of (capture)_(year)_(month)_(day)_(hour)_(minutes)_(seconds).  This will also create a DDS thumbnail in a folder adjacent to the capture directory with the same name as the capture including the USD file type.
Once you've captured your first game scene, you're all set to create a new project in Omniverse using the RTX Remix Renderer. You'll notice that the RTX Runtime has made a folder called **rtx-remix**.  Inside this folder, you'll find all the materials, textures, lights, and meshes for the game scene you captured in USD format.

> üìù Before creating your project file, please see the section on _Renaming Captures_ in the _Best Practices_ section.
