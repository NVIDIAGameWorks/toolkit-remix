# Understanding CONF Files

Before we dive into replacing assets, let's take a moment to get familiar with the settings in the **Alt+X** menu, specifically in the "game setup" tab. Here, you'll find functions that allow you to change how certain textures in the game are rendered. Keep in mind that these options can vary depending on the game you're working on, but the tooltips should provide some initial guidance.

For instance, marking a texture as a "sky texture" will automatically make it emissive and ensure it's always visible to the player, even if it's in a separate space like the skybox (this is particularly important in Source Engine games). It's also a good idea to mark UI textures to make sure they aren't affected by the new rendering pipeline. If you want more detailed information on how these settings work, you can refer to the dedicated **RTX.conf** breakdown.
