# Introduction to Material Replacement

In Remix, materials on meshes get a PBR (Physically-Based Rendering) makeover, allowing you to use high-quality and more physically accurate Materials in your game. In this tutorial, we'll focus on replacing materials for world geometry. If you want to replace materials on models, check out the Model Replacement section of this guide.


## Ingesting Material Textures

1. **Navigate to the Ingest Tab:** Head to the Ingest tab and select "Texture Ingestion."
2. **Add Your Texture:** Click "Add" and effortlessly upload the texture of your choice (supports PNG or DDS formats).
3. **Assign Texture Channel (Optional):**
    * Explore the "convention" dropdown below the input file paths box.
    * Set it to DirectX, OpenGL, or Octahedral based on the encoding type of your input normal map.
    * Assign the texture to one of seven channels: Diffuse, Emissive Mask, Metallic, Normal - OpenGL, Normal - DirectX, Roughness, or Other.
    * Opt for "Other" for a standardized ingestion without altering the name. This step is often automated, but choose "Other" for textures like heightmaps#
4. **Set Output Directory:** Establish an output directory within your project file structure.
4. **Initiate Ingestion:**
    * Click "Run" to kickstart the texture export process.
    * The output directory will contain additional files, but all you need for in-game use is the converted DDS file.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Issues with Ingestion will be highlighted in red with corresponding error messages.

> üìù All Ingested files, even Materials & Assets, will have MetaData files.

## Replacing, Adding, or Appending a Material

**Replacing a Material**
This involves substituting an existing Material with a new one.

**Adding a Material**
Adding a Material typically refers to incorporating a new Material alongside existing ones.

**Appending a Material**
 Appending a Material implies sequentially adding Materials to a project. For example, you might start with a basic scene and then append additional Materials to enhance or expand the environment.

1. **Access Stage:** Go to the "Modding" tab on the top right.
2. **Select Asset Replacements:** Choose the "Asset Replacements" tab on the left.
3. **Layers:** In the top left, you'll see layers. Select your desired layer as the edit target.
4. **Choose Mesh:** Pick your mesh for texture replacement.
5. **Selection Tab:** Look at the "Selection" tab, where you'll find the original Material hash and the converted/captured USD.
6. **Add New Reference (Optional):** If you are replacing a model, follow the steps above for ‚ÄúReplacing, Adding, or Appending an Asset‚Äù.
7. **Material Properties:** Scroll down to view the ‚ÄúMaterial Properties‚Äù tab on your selected asset. 
8. **Assigning Textures:** Click the arrow next to a material property to see a list of adjustments you can make. 
    * _For example:_ In the Base Material dropdown, you can add an Albedo, Roughness, Metallic, and Normal Map texture.
    * If you are replacing a texture on a captured model, the original captured texture will be present in the ‚ÄúAlbedo‚Äù channel. 
9. **Selecting Textures:** Click the browse icon to navigate to your texture file pathing and then select it to add the texture to that channel


## Checking Hash Stability

World geometry has unstable hashes in many older games due to culling mechanisms. To check hash stability, follow these steps:

1. **In-Game Debugging:** In-game, press Alt+X, scroll down to the "Debug" tab under "Rendering", and enable "Debug View".
2. **Check Hash Stability:** To make sure that everything is working smoothly, switch to "Geometry Hash" in the debug view. If you notice a model, Material, or a part of the game world changing color in this view, that's a sign that the hash isn't stable. In such cases, you might need to use a workaround, and replacing it might not be an option.

## Understanding Parallax Occlusion Mapping in RTX Remix

Parallax Occlusion Mapping (POM) is a technique used in RTX Remix to add depth and realism to surfaces. It's achieved by simulating the displacement of pixels based on a height map, creating the illusion of intricate surface details.

**What is Displacement Using Parallax Occlusion Mapping?**

Displacement is a family of techniques used to make simple geometry appear more complex than it actually is.  In the context of RTX Remix, this is done using Parallax Occlusion Mapping.

**Depth of a Pixel**

In Remix, four factors determine the depth of the displacement, which is calculated as:
(height_map_pixel * displace_in * rtx.displacement.displacementFactor)

* <code>Height_map_pixel</code> A black pixel will be displaced back the full distance, a white pixel will not be displaced at all.
* <code>displace_in</code> A material property that determines how deep a particular material appears
* <code>rtx.displacement.displacementFactor</code> A global RtxOption primarily used for debugging.  We recommend leaving this at 1.0.
* UV density of a given surface (i.e. how often the texture tiles)
* For example, if you have a wall panel that tiles every 1.5 meters, a black pixel will appear to be 1.5 * <code>displace_in</code> meters behind the wall. A gray pixel will be 0.75 meters behind the wall, and a white pixel will not be changed.

**Comparison with Substance Designer**

In Substance Designer, a black pixel on the height map is 1 unit * <code>height_scale</code> deep, with the default preview mesh being 100x100 units.

**Adjusting displace_in for Consistency**

* To match the depth of the surface in Remix with Substance Designer's preview, adjust <code>displace_in</code> as follows: <code>displace_in = height_scale</code> / 100.
* This adjustment ensures that the displacement scale in Remix is consistent with Substance Designer's default preview mesh.

**Considerations for Custom Meshes**

If the artist uses a custom mesh in Substance Designer, the adjustment factor for <code>displace_in</code> may need to be fine-tuned based on the specific characteristics of the custom mesh.  Substance Designer does not factor in the UV density when calculating depth, so rather than simply dividing by 100, they will need to divide by the UV density of their custom mesh.

## Animated Materials

Working with animated textures involves a few additional steps. Follow this easy guide:

1. **Capture Each Frame:** Slow down the game's framerate to capture each frame of the animated texture.
2. **Use Anchor Textures:**
    * Generate a series of Anchor or stand-in textures for each animation frame.
    * Render these textures into a test level to capture the hashes.
3. **Utilize the Alt+X Developer Menu:**
    * Access the material setup tab in the Alt+X developer menu.
    * Tick on "preserve discarded textures" to retain all the hashes for each frame in the material menu.
4. **Create a Hash List:** Make a list of all the hashes obtained from the preserved frames in the material menu.
5. **Manual Replacement in USDA:** Replace these hashes through simple manual editing in a layer's USDA.

### Animated Materials using a Sprite Sheet

To bring animations from a sprite sheet into the application, it's a simple process. The user just needs to specify three things: 
1. The number of rows
1. The number of columns
1. The desired frames per second

Once you've set these values, ensure that all your Materials are configured to use sprite sheet Materials.

A key point to remember is that the spritesheet should be organized from left to right, and from top to bottom, just like the example image presented below:

<!--- ![SpriteSheetExample](data/images/sprite_sheet_example.png) --->
<img src="../data/images/sprite_sheet_example.png" alt="drawing" width="400"/>
